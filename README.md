## 📘 **What is Data Science?**
> **Data Science** is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from data.

### ✨ Key Components:
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Predictive Modeling
- Communicating Results

## 🤖 **What is Machine Learning?**

> Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### 🧠 Common ML Types:
- **Supervised Learning** (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM)
- **Unsupervised Learning** (e.g., Clustering, PCA)
- **Reinforcement Learning** (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks)

### 📚 Popular Libraries:
- `Scikit-learn`
- `TensorFlow`
- `Keras`
- `PyTorch`

## 🧬 **What is Generative AI?**

> Generative AI refers to AI systems capable of generating text, images, audio, or other media in response to prompts. It's powered by deep learning and transformer models.

### 🔥 Technologies Behind Generative AI:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT
- Diffusion Models (for image generation)
- Transformers and Attention Mechanisms

### 🎨 Use Cases:
- Text Generation
- Image Synthesis
- Chatbots
- Code Generation

## 📊 **What is Data Analytics?**

> **Data Analytics** is the process of examining data sets to draw conclusions. It's a key aspect of business intelligence and decision-making.

### 🔍 Types of Data Analytics:
- **Descriptive**: What happened?
- **Diagnostic**: Why did it happen?
- **Predictive**: What will happen?
- **Prescriptive**: What should we do?

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- `Excel` / `Google Sheets`
- `SQL`
- `Power BI`
- `Tableau`
- `Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)`
